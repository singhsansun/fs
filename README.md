# fs
A JavaScript user script that creates citations of external websites, to be used on FamilySearch.

## Configuration

1. Install a browser extension that allows to execute user scripts. For example:
   * Tampermonkey (all major browsers): https://tampermonkey.net/
   * Greasemonkey (Firefox): https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/
2. Open the extension, and create a new userscript. (In the Tampermonkey dashboard, click the button with a '+'.)
3. Remove the default text from the userscript, and replace it with the contents of fs-sources.js (copy-paste).
4. Don't forget to save the userscript (in Tampermonkey: File > Save, Ctrl-S or âŒ˜-S).
5. You're set to go. If you want to use the userscript in a tab that is already open, don't forget to refresh the tab.
